%TODO write introduction

 This chapter will first specify three use-cases, specified in the project assignment, in which an \gls{acr-AOD} must operate. It then describes basic principles, applications and tools relevant for these use cases.

\section{Use cases}\label{sec:usecases}
The use case below are determined by ir. F. Hofstra, these cases are expected to be valid and realistic. Keeping in mind their marketability. These cases will determine the needed functionality for an \gls{acr-AOD} and stand at the basis for the controller design.

\subsection{Arbitrary shaped space}\label{sec:usecase1}
An \gls{acr-AOD} is placed in a predefined arbitrary shaped space, not too complex, with an area of \( 3500 \si{\square\metre} \). The shape of this space is set, but the movement pattern is unrestricted. The \gls{acr-AOD} has to remove a layer with a depth of \( 5 \si{\cm} \). The controller has to determine an optimal path with the least amount of time or the shortest path. This can be coupled with learning capabilities and an analyze capacity. At a later time additional constrains can be added which keep in mind the deployment location of a flexible \gls{gls-dredgeline} and an \gls{gls-umbilical}.

\subsection{Marina Aqua Delta}\label{sec:usecase2}
The \gls{acr-AOD} operates in a predefined space with obstacles, not every obstacles is known. The actual location is \href{https://www.google.nl/maps/place/Jachthaven+Bruinisse/@51.6712838,4.0824101,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x9c840ab80bde39c8}{marina Aqua Delta} located in Bruinisse, the Netherlands. The shape of this location is set but the movement pattern is unrestricted. An \gls{acr-AOD}  has to remove a layer with a depth of \( 5 \si{\cm} \). The controller has to determine an optimal path with the least amount of time or the shortest path. This can be coupled with learning capabilities and an analyze capacity. The marina has enough depth for the \gls{acr-AOD} to move underneath the scaffolding.
No consideration has to be made for a flexible \gls{gls-dredgeline} and a \gls{gls-umbilical}. These conditions are introduced at a later stage.

\subsection{Three Gorges dam}\label{sec:usecase3}
An \gls{acr-AOD} operates in a predefined space with obstacles, not every location of those obstacles is known. The predefined space is located at the foot of \href{https://www.google.nl/maps/place/Three+Gorges+Dam/@30.8263416,111.0118356,16z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x368476d5e9a340d9:0xa017b4d524bd9d6c}{three Gorges dam}. Silt is deposited at the foot of this dam, due to natural occurring \gls{gls-erosion} and \gls{gls-sedimentation}. The accumulation of \gls{gls-silt} can be controlled by dredging localized pits. Which in turn create locations with a lower density. This induces a gravity driven density current towards those locations. The \gls{acr-AOD} has to maintain an average nominal depth with a certain silt deposit rate.
