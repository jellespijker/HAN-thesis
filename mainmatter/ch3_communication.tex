\section{UNDERWATER COMMUNICATION}\label{sec:communication}
This section describes various principles of underwater communication. It identifies two basic methods of transmitting data, namely: wired communication or wireless communication. Wired communication will be in a form of an \gls[first]{gls-umbilical}. Using regular and industry standard communication protocols. While wireless communication can be performed through four basic principles. These are: electromagnetic, electric current, acoustic or optical signals. Of these principles only electromagnetic and acoustic are explored, since an electrical current doesn't work in a fresh water reservoir and optical signals get sub-optimal performance in a dredging environment. Due the diffraction and scattering of light by floating floating sand particles.

The environment presented in the uses cases, described in section~\ref{sec:usecases}, state that the crawler will operate in fresh water basins. It is also likely that it will be connected to the water surface with a floating \gls{gls-dredgeline}. The choice for wired communication is therefore easily made. There may however still be a need for wireless communication with external sensors. Such as the principles presented in section~\ref{sec:coverageunderuncertainty} illustrate. Where an option to minimize a localization error using multiple bots, is presented.

\subsection{WIRED COMMUNICATION}\label{sec:wired communication}
With wired communication, data signals are transmitted over a wire. Which acts as a pathway where the information is transmitted as a digital \gls[first]{gls-bitstream}. Transmission of information through this wire is limited by a certain bandwidth in \( \si{\hertz} \).
Where the limiting factors are material properties such as: conductivity, permittivity and permeability. As well as processing of the signals at the end and start node. Communication wires are made of a carrier medium, such as copper or glass fibre.
This carrier medium facilitate transmission of electromagnetic waves or currents. Where electromagnetic waves, such as light, are transmitted through fibre optic cables, where a modulated pulse of light propagates through a glass tube through the principle of \gls[first]{acr-TIR}.
Where  electromagnetic communication makes use of copper wires, where an electric charge propagates through the cable. Copper is the industry de-facto due to its excellent electrical conductivity properties.

\citet{babani_comparative_nodate} made a comparative study between fibre-optic and copper cables in a context of modern network protocol. They identified the following properties for comparison: bandwidth, cost, dimensional properties (such as weight, size and flexibility), signal loss and safety and immunity.
They illustrate that fibre optics cables, although more expensive, are the better choice. By stating that fibre-optic cables are smaller and lighter compare to metal cables, especially copper based. Optical fibre occupies less space in conduits than copper cabling and weighs less too. Furthermore, they allow for tighter bend radius than any copper cables. And signals don't cross-talk with different wires.
The low signal attenuation performance and superior signal integrity found in fibre optical systems facilitates much longer runs for signal transmission. The attenuation loss experienced in fibre optic cables can be attributed to microscopic and macroscopic impurities in the fibre material and structure, which cause absorption and scattering of light signal.
In figure~\ref{fig:attenuationFibreVSCopper} the attenuation loss of \( 1 \si{\km} \) of cable is shown as a function of frequency. Both signals propagate with nearly the same speed through their corresponding wire, but when a high data throughput is wanted.  It becomes evident from this figure that usage of fibre-optics are paramount.

\begin{RoyalFigure}[htb]{EFFECTIVE ATTENUATION FIBRE VS COPPER CABLE 1 km~\cite{joseph_c_palais_fibre_1998}}
  \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{attenuationFibreVSCopper}
\end{RoyalFigure}

Other important factors to consider, for an underwater wired-communication between a base station and a dredge bot, are the effects of the wire on the bot itself. \citet{whitcomb_underwater_2000} states that most present day vehicles are \gls[first]{acr-ROV} --- tele-operated vehicles  employing an \gls{gls-umbilical} cable to carry both power and telemetry from a mother-ship to the vehicle.
He further states that a growing number of research vehicles are \gls[first]{acr-AUV} --- which operate without an \gls{gls-umbilical} tether. This statement is supported by \citet{valavanis_control_1997}, whom describes that the \gls{acr-ROV} \gls{gls-umbilical} cable constrains the vehicle to operations in close proximity to the support ship.
Because the crawler is tethered to a location above water level, due to it's floating \gls{gls-dredgeline}, and because this crawler is from its starting-point constructed as a \gls{acr-ROV}, it will, in all likelihood, be controlled through an \gls{gls-umbilical}.

\citet{westneat_advances_1983} describes that, as the range of operations becomes longer and water deeper, the drag exerted by the tether becomes significant. The thrusters, and thus the vehicle itself, must become larger and the cable thicker, and the energy that goes into the cable maintenance becomes a major factor. This factor is illustrated by \citet{fang_motions_2007}, whom describes a mathematical model which allow the state representation of the dredge bot, as described in section~\ref{sec:state representation}, to be modified by the forces that are exerted on the cable.
In these equations, mass and inertia of the cable play an important role. Because these are just a fraction of the properties for a \gls{gls-dredgeline}, it is assumed that these forces can be neglected. According to \citet{feng_evaluation_2004} the effects of the cable can be reduced when it is deployed by a drum on the shore with negligible tension when it is pulled by the vehicle.

\subsubsection*{Protocols}\label{sec:wired_protocols}
The signals which are transported through the wires need to adhere to certain rules and conventions. In other words, the transponder and receiver need to speak the same language and be aware of etiquette, such that a message is received as intended. The \gls[first]{acr-IEEE}, have dictated most of the widespread used norms today. The most common used norm in wired communication is \textit{IEEE 802.3} or as it is more commonly known Ethernet. Which consists of a multitude of protocols. In this \gls{acr-IEEE} norms are the physical layer, data link layers and the \gls[first]{acr-MAC} for each protocol defined.

Shortly put, \gls{acr-MAC} is defined as the lower sub layer of the data link layer and provides addressing and channel access control mechanisms that allow for communication between several terminals, or nodes, within a multiple access network. This layer act as an interface between the \gls[first]{acr-LLC} sub layer and the network's physical layer. Where the \gls{acr-LLC} makes it possible to let several network protocols coexist.
According to \citet{jolectra_plc_2016} the current dredge bot makes use of an \textit{Allen Bradley ETHERNET/IP adapter} of type \textit{1769-AENTR}, which is allows the use \gls[first]{acr-CIP}, \gls[first]{acr-TCP} and \gls[first]{acr-UDP}. Where \gls{acr-CIP} is used by EtherNet/IP, and is a familiar and widely used protocol for controllers.

\subsection{WIRELESS COMMUNICATION}
\citet{freitas_evaluation_2014} tells us that wireless communications have been subject to enormous research and improvements in the near past. This effort is  responsible for allowing multiple devices to securely communicate simultaneously with high availability, great distances and high data rates. While these improvements are applied and tested mainly in over-the-air communications, underwater communications suffer from a low applicability of radio frequency transmission systems due to a low attenuation of \gls[first]{acr-EMW}  in water.

He~\cite{freitas_evaluation_2014} further states that When using radio frequency, underwater communications does not fully benefit from the improvements achieved in air since electromagnetic propagation in water causes a big reduction in the effective range. Because of the limitations that water imposes, these communications are currently performed using acoustic waves and in some cases optical systems. This is further supported by \citet{lloret_underwater_2012} who remarks that underwater communication research is primarily focused on the use of optical signals, electromagnetic signals and the propagation of acoustic and ultrasonic signals.
Each technique has its own characteristics, with its benefits and drawbacks, mainly due to the chemical characteristics~\cite{garcia_underwater_2011} and physical constraints of the medium~\cite{lanbo_prospects_2008}.

\subsubsection{ELECTROMAGNETIC COMMUNICATION}\label{sec:em}
A common method to transfer data via a wireless connection is to make use of \gls{acr-EMW}, these are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum. As is shown in figure~\ref{fig:emspectrum}. Waves in this spectrum can have frequencies between \( 3 \si{\kilo\hertz} \) or \( 3 \si{\giga\hertz} \).
These waves travel the speed of light and are transverse waves, because the amplitude is perpendicular to the direction of the wave travel. However, \gls{acr-EMW} are always waves of fields, not of matter, because they are fields, \gls{acr-EMW} can propagate in empty space~\cite{giancoli_physics_2015}.

\begin{RoyalFigure}[!htb, label=fig:emspectrum]{ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM~\cite{giancoli_physics_2015}}
   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{emspectrum.png}
 \end{RoyalFigure}

 Data is transferred between devices by either modulating the frequency or the amplitude of a signal data can be transferred. Where a carrier frequency is modulated by superimposing a data signal. Which is illustrated in figure~\ref{fig:AMFM}.

\begin{RoyalFigure}[htb, label=fig:AMFM]{SIGNAL MODULATION}

         \end{axis}
       \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{tcbraster}
\end{RoyalFigure}

\citet{hagman_elias_design_2009} tell us that the reasons, why \gls{acr-EMW} are used to transfer information in the classic wireless air channel, lies in their fast propagation speed. In their wide usable frequency spectrum and coupled with a small environment noise, compared for example with acoustics factors. This all leads high possible data rates. Furthermore, the \gls{acr-EMW} has the ability to propagate without a carrier medium and the electric-magnetic field conversion enables in general very large communication ranges.

But in water --- especially in seawater --- things get different. This is statement is supported by \citet{ramakrishna_next_2012} whom tells that the ocean is almost impervious to \gls{acr-EMW}, which makes them useless for wireless underwater communication over distances greater than a hundred meters.
\citet{hagman_elias_design_2009} illustrate this by solving \gls{gls-maxwell} to predict the propagation of \gls{acr-EMW} for the case of a linearly \gls{gls-polarized-plane} travelling in \(z\)-direction,
we get the \gls{gls-electric-field} strength \gls{sym-E_x}  and the \gls{gls-magnetic-field} strength \gls{sym-H_y}~\cite{hagman_elias_design_2009}.

	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{RoyalFigure}

Where \gls{sym-E_hat}  and \gls{sym-H_hat} are the amplitudes of the electric and the magnetic field wave and \gls[first]{sym-gamma_EM} expressed in \gls[first]{sym-epsilon_e}, as shown in equation~\ref{eq:propegationconst},
where \gls[first]{sym-mu_e} and \gls[first]{sym-sigma_e} of a material. Here \gls[first]{sym-alpha_e} and \gls[first]{sym-beta}.

	\begin{equation}\label{eq:MaxwellE}
		\gls{sym-E_x} = \gls{sym-E_hat} \gls{sym-exp}^{\gls{sym-imag}  \omega t - \gamma z}
	\end{equation}

	\begin{equation}\label{eq:MaxwellH}
		\gls{sym-H_y}  = \gls{sym-H_hat} \gls{sym-exp}^{\gls{sym-imag}  \omega t - \gamma z}
	\end{equation}

	\begin{equation}\label{eq:propegationconst}
		\gls{sym-gamma_EM}  = \gls{sym-imag}  \omega \sqrt{\gls{sym-epsilon_e}  \gls{sym-mu_e}  - \frac{\gls{sym-imag}
    \gls{sym-sigma_e}  \gls{sym-mu_e} }{\omega}} = \alpha + \gls{sym-imag} \gls{sym-beta}
	\end{equation}

	\begin{equation}\label{eq:attfactor}
	 \gls{sym-alpha_e}  \approx 0.0173 \sqrt{f \gls{sym-sigma_e} }
	\end{equation}

As is evident from equation~\ref{eq:MaxwellE} and~\ref{eq:MaxwellH}, there is a logarithmic relationship, maximization of the propagation \gls{sym-gamma_EM}  leads to a lower amplitude of the electric and magnetic fields. This propagation is mostly determine by the attenuation \gls{sym-alpha_e}, which varies at different frequencies and mediums.
\citet{claus_design_2014} tells us that this attenuation factor is given as equation~\ref{eq:attfactor}, which shows us that the attenuation is related to the square root of the frequency \( f \) in hertz \(\si{\hertz}\), multiplied by the conductivity of the water \gls{sym-sigma_e}  in \si{\siemens\per\meter}.
Whilst \citet{hattab_underwater_2013} states that the loss of a signal travelling through water can be calculated using equation~\ref{eq:attloss}. They state that the knowing the real-part of \gls{sym-gamma_EM} is sufficient to calculate the loss for a given frequency. Since the only changing term due to frequency in the complex-valued \gls{sym-gamma_EM} is in its imaginary part, and due to the fact that each \gls{sym-gamma_EM} is multiplied with \gls{sym-imag}, both outside of the root as inside, this value while be a constant through out the frequency spectrum. And this attenuation model will not be used for our calculations.

	Where \gls{sym-Delta_d_1_2}  is the separation distance between transmitting and receiving nodes and only the real part of the propagation constant \gls{sym-sigma_e} is used.
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:attloss}
    \gls{sym-L_alpha_epsilon} = \Re(\gls{sym-gamma_EM}) = \frac{20}{\ln(10)} \gls{sym-Delta_d_1_2} \Rightarrow
     \gls{sym-Delta_d_1_2} \frac{\gls{sym-L_alpha_epsilon}}{\Re( \gls{sym-gamma_EM} )\frac{20}{\ln(10)}} = \frac{\gls{sym-L_alpha_epsilon} }{\gls{sym-alpha_e} }
	\end{equation}

The maximum penetration depth of signal in (sea) water, will, for simplicity’s sake be calculated with equation~\ref{eq:attloss}, where \gls{sym-alpha_e} is obtained using equation~\ref{eq:attfactor}.
\citet{jiang_electromagnetic_2011} tells us that seawater has a typically high conductivity of \SI{4}{\siemens\per\meter}, whilst freshwater has a typically conductivity of only \SI{0.01}{\siemens\per\meter}, \num{400} times less.
He \cite{jiang_electromagnetic_2011} further states that communication using electromagnetic waves in fresh water can be more efficient in fresh water.
This statements are confirmed by \citet{jiang_electromagnetic_2011},~\citet{ainslie_principles_2010} and~\citet{bogie_conduction_1972}.
 Figure~\ref{fig:propagationrange} and~\ref{fig:propagationrange_wifi}, which shows the \gls{acr-EMW} propagation in fresh and seawater for commonly used frequencies, illustrate this phenomenon.

\subsubsection{PROTOCOLS}
Sub-section \ref{sec:wired_protocols} describes the need for protocols as an transceiver and receiver speaking the same language and adhering to the same etiquette. This holds true for wireless protocols as well. Most wireless protocols are described in the \gls{acr-IEEE} 802 standards. These are a family of standard network protocols. Describing networks caring variable-size packets. These protocols are the de-facto industry standards. A short description for the most popular 802 standards are given below. These protocols map to two layers, namely: Data link and physical layers. Where the data link layer is split into two sub-layers \gls{acr-LLC} and \gls{acr-MAC}. Where the \gls{acr-LLC} provides the multiplexing mechanisms that enable the network protocols and provide flow control and automatic repeat requests. Whilst \gls{acr-MAC} provides addressing and channel access control mechanisms that makes it possible for several nodes to communicate within a multiple access network.

\paragraph{IEEE 802.11 WLAN} \hfil \\
The IEEE 802.11 standard is also known as WiFi. It encompasses wireless modulation techniques, designates as 802.11(a, b, g, n and ac). The 802.11 standard makes use of the \SI{2.4}{\giga\hertz} and \SI{5}{\giga\hertz} \gls{gls-bandwidth}. \citet{freitas_evaluation_2014} states that Wi-Fi frequencies maybe a challenge when used in underwater communications, because its attenuation drastically reduce the channel distance. As is shown in figure~\ref{fig:propagationrange_wifi}.
A new standard 802.11af is being developed. This standard will make use of the \SI{700}{\mega\hertz} $ 700 [MHz] $ frequency. Which might give an extra couple of meters underwater.

\paragraph{IEEE 802.15.4 LO-FI} \hfill \\
From all different protocols described in the \gls{acr-IEEE} 802.15 special consideration is made into the \gls{acr-IEEE} 802.15.14 or \gls{gls-lora}.
Which is an upcoming communication protocol for \gls[first]{acr-IoT} devices. It operates in \SI{433}{\mega\hertz} and \SIrange{863}{870}{\mega\hertz}. The protocols are opensource and the modules are very cheap. This protocol is developed for robust long range communication, which can reach \SI{22}{\kilo\meter} on land.
\citet{akyildiz_underwater_2005} tells us that the electromagnetic waves at \SI{433}{\mega\hertz} have been reported to have a transmission range of \SI{120}{\cm} in underwater environment. These experiments have been performed at the \gls{acr-RESL} at the University of Southern California.

Because of the use of lower frequencies, \gls{gls-lora} shows a three-fold increase in range compared with normal WiFi. The propagation of \gls{gls-lora} signal in (sea-)water is shown in figure~\ref{fig:propagationrange}.
When this is compared with figure~\ref{fig:propagationrange_wifi} in increase in range is found.

\subsubsection{ELECTRIC CURRENT}\label{sec:ec}
 Another way to communicate is through the use of electric current. \citet{hagman_elias_design_2009} describes that seawater, as a conductive medium, can be subject to a modulated signal generated by a pair of transmitting electrodes, that launch a current field in the channel. If this current field is strong enough, the receiver --- that also uses a pair of electrodes --- could measure a potential difference and therefore receive the signal. Since electric current noise is extremely low in seawater, small current fields amplitudes are sufficient to receive information and a large data rate is achievable \cite{hagman_elias_design_2009}.
 Since this type of transmission only works in a conductive medium, and the use case only specify that a dredge bot will be deployed in fresh water basins, electric current communication is not deemed a viable candidate.

\subsubsection{ACOUSTIC COMMUNICATION}\label{sec:ac}
As is shown in section~\ref{sec:em}, \gls{acr-EMW} have a very limited range in (sea) water, due to a high attenuation. Multiple sources such as \citet{hagman_elias_design_2009}, \citet{claus_design_2014} and \citet{domingo_overview_2012} state that acoustic communication is therefore the preferred way.
This type of communication makes use of \gls[first]{acr-SW}, or \gls[first]{acr-AW}, which are often described as vibration of molecules of the medium in which it travels --- that is, in terms of the motion or displacement of the molecules. \gls{acr-SW}  can also be analysed from the point of view of pressure. Indeed, longitudinal waves are often called pressure waves. The pressure variation is usually easier to measure then the displacement~\cite{giancoli_physics_2015}. This principle is used by hydrophones; These are in-effect microphones designed to be used underwater. Using piezoelectric transducers to convert pressure waves in to electricity.
 Although acoustic communication is the preferred method, there are a lot of challenges to overcome. According to~\citet{tetley_electronic_2007} transmitting and receiving acoustic energy in seawater is affected by the often unpredictable ocean environment.
 \citet{lanbo_prospects_2008} and~\citet{edward_tucholski_underwater_2006} both state that the speed of sound in the sea is not constant, but  a function of temperature, pressure and salinity \( v(T, P, S) \). Because the speed is not constant sound does not travel in a straight line.
 Acoustic communicationand can be summarized as follows:

 \begin{RoyalTable}{X[2,l,m] X[4,l,m]}
   \RoyalHeader{PARAMETER|VALUE}
   \RoyalRow{Attenuation|A variable factor related to the transmitted power, the frequency of transmission, salinity of the seawater and the reflective consistency of the ocean floor.}
	 \RoyalRow{Salinity of seawater|A variable factor affecting both the velocity of the \gls{acr-AW}  and its attenuation.}
   \RoyalRow{Velocity of sound in salt water|This is another variable parameter. Acoustic wave velocity is precisely \SI{1505}{\meter\per\second} at \SI{15}{\degreeCelsius} and atmospheric pressure, but most echo-sounding equipment is calibrated at \SI{1500}{\meter\per\second}}
   \RoyalRow{Reflective surface of the seabed|The amplitude of the reflected energy varies with the consistency of the ocean floor.}
   \RoyalRow{Noise|Either inherent noise or that produced by one’s own transmission causes the signal-to-noise ratio to degrade, and thus weak echo signals may be lost in noise.}
   \RoyalRow{Frequency of transmission|This will vary with the system, i.e. depth sounding or Doppler speed log.}
   \RoyalRow{Angle of incidence of the propagated beam|The closer the angle to vertical the greater will be the	energy reflected by the seabed.}
\end{RoyalTable}
