key|name|plural|description
cooling-load|cooling load|cooling loads|a rate at which sensible and latent heat must be removed from the space to maintain a constant space dry-bulb air temperature and humidity
lora|LoRa|LoRa|A wireless technology that has been developed to enable low data rate communications to be made over long distances by sensors and actuators for M2M and Internet of Things, IoT applications
auger-dredge-head|auger dredge head|auger dredge heads|consists of two opposite-thread spiral cutters on a horizontal tubular body. The soil is cut by the spiral cutters, and the pitch ensures that it is carried to the center of the auger, where the suction head is situated.
bandwidth|bandwidth|bandwidths|a difference between the upper and lower frequencies in a continuous set of frequencies
bitstream|bitstream|bitstreams|a sequential binary sequence
black-body|black body|black bodies|an idealized physical body that absorbs all incident electromagnetic radiation, regardless of frequency or angle of incidence
closed-system|closed system|closed systems|a physical system that doesn't exchange any matter with its surroundings, and isn't subject to any net force whose source is external to the system
conduction|conduction|conduction's|a transfer of heat by microscopic collisions of particles and movement of electrons within a body
convection|convection|convection's|an algorithm that uses a series of measurements observed over time, containing statistical noise and other inaccuracies, and produces estimates of unknown variables that tend to be more precise than those based on a single measurement alone, by using Bayesian inference and estimating a joint probability distribution over the variables for each time frame
draghead|draghead|dragheads|a suction mouth which is dragged across a water body
dredgeline|dredgeline|dredgelines|a pipeline which transports excavated slurry
electric-field|electric field|electric fields|a vector field that associates to each point in space the Coulomb force that would be experienced per unit of electric charge, by an infinitesimal test charge at that point.[1] Electric fields converge and diverge at electric charges and can be induced by time-varying magnetic fields
erosion|erosion|erosions|an action of surface processes (such as water flow or wind) that removes soil
graph|graph|graphs|a mathematical structure used to model pairwise relations between objects. A graph in this context is made up of vertices, nodes, or points which are connected by edges, arcs, or lines
heating-load|heating load|heating loads|a rate at which sensible and latent heat must be added to the space to maintain a constant space dry-bulb air temperature and humidity
hopper|hopper|hoppers|a storage container or compartment
Kalman-filter|Kalman filter|Kalman filters|an algorithm that uses a series of measurements observed over time, containing statistical noise and other inaccuracies, and produces estimates of unknown variables that tend to be more precise than those based on a single measurement alone, by using Bayesian inference and estimating a joint probability distribution over the variables for each time frame
latent-heat|latent heat|latent heats|thermal energy released or absorbed by a body
magnetic-field|magnetic field|magnetic fields|a magnetic effect of electric currents and magnetic materials. The magnetic field at any given point is specified by both a direction and a magnitude (or strength); as such it is a vector field
maxwell|Maxwell's equation|Maxwell's equations|are a set of partial differential equations that, together with the Lorentz force law, form the foundation of classical electrodynamics, classical optics, and electric circuits
MTIpython|MTIpython|MTIpythonâ€™s|a Python package, used within IHC, to solve engineering problems in the disciplines: fluids, thermodynamics, mechanical and electrical
node|node|nodes|fundamental unit of which graphs are formed
open-system|open system|open systems|a system that has external interactions. Such interactions can take the form of information, energy, or material transfers into or out of the system boundary
polarized-plane|polarized plane|polarized planes|is a confinement of the electric field vector or magnetic field vector to a given plane along the direction of propagation
Python|Python|Pythons|an interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming
radiation|radiation|radiations|an electromagnetic radiation generated by the thermal motion of charged particles in matter. All matter with a temperature greater than absolute zero emits thermal radiation
refrigerant|refrigerant|refrigerants|a substance or mixture, used in heat pumps to transport heat energy
resistor|resistor|resistors|a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element
Sankey diagram|Sankey diagram|Sankey diagrams|a specific type of flow diagram, in which the width of the arrows is shown proportionally to the flow quantity
sedimentation|sedimentation|sedimentations|"the opposite of erosion| it is  tendency for particles in suspension to settle out of the fluid in which they are entrained and come to rest against a barrier"
silt|silt|silts|a granular material of a size between sand and clay
slurry|slurry|slurries|describe a mixture that consist of both solid and fluid phases
solvent|solvent|solvents|a substance that dissolves a solute, such as a chemically distinct liquid, solid or gas, resulting in a solution
